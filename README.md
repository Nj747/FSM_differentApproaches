# Different approaches of Finite States Machine
This repo contains different ways to implement finite states machine in Unity3D + C#

1. ***Naive Approach*** : It contains an example of two states (Idle and Aggro) with one condition. It is cool to understand FSM logic (States and transitions).
---
2. ***State Pattern*** : It contains an example applying the same two states (Idle and Aggro), but making use of the state pattern approach.
