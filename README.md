# Different approaches of Finite States Machine
This repo contains different ways to implement finite states machine in Unity3D + C#

> ***Dependencies -> Unity 2019.3.15f1***

1. ***Naive Approach*** : It contains an example of two states (Idle and Aggro) with one condition. It is cool to understand FSM logic (States and transitions). 

✅ Individual code available

---
2. ***State Pattern*** : It contains an example applying the same two states (Idle and Aggro), but making use of the state pattern approach. 

✅ Unity Package available to import project files
 
✅ Individual code it's also available
